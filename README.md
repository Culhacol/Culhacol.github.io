**Northeast VS Southeast Minnesota**

The geology of Minnesota is quite a long and confusing one. There are many many factors and events to take into account. But before we get into the specifics, we need to recap important general geology content.
There are three main types of rocks. Igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling of magma and lava, and the rock is classified differently depending on where it is formed. If rock formed from magma underground, it is called an intrusive igneous rock. 	If a rock formed from lava on the surface, it is called an extrusive igneous rock. The main types of intrusive igneous rocks found in Minnesota are Gabbro, Anorthosite, and Granite. The main types of extrusive igneous rocks found in Minnesota are Basalt and Rhyolite. 
There are three types of sedimentary rocks; clastic, chemical, and organic. Clastic sedimentary rocks are what most people think of when they hear the words “sedimentary rocks.” Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed by the erosion, deposition, and compaction of sediments. Chemical sedimentary rocks are formed from the precipitation of particles. Not to be confused with precipitation, which is rain, snow or hail falling to the ground, to precipitate is to become a solid. Organic sedimentary rocks are formed from the remains of dead organisms. An example of an organic sedimentary rock is Coal, although there is not enough of it in Minnesota to be noteworthy. Examples of clastic sedimentary rocks in Minnesota are Sandstone and Shale. Examples of chemical sedimentary rocks in Minnesota are Limestone and Dolostone.
Metamorphic rocks are formed when other types of rocks go under intense heat and/or pressure. The two types of metamorphism are Contact metamorphism and Regional metamorphism. Contact metamorphism is when a rock is metamorphosed through intense heat. Regional metamorphism is when a rock is metamorphosed through intense pressure. The main types of metamorphic rocks in Minnesota are Gneiss, Slate, and Greenstone. Now you might be wondering how metamorphic rocks formed if there’s no fault lines or volcanoes in Minnesota. Well we’ll get back to that.
The rocks in Minnesota are many different ages. Some of them are one point eight billion years old, some are one point one billion years old, and some are only four hundred fifty million years old. And now it is time to recap the entire history of Minnesota, North America, and the Earth. Four point six billion years ago, the earth formed. Yippee! Then a Mars-sized object hits the Earth, and now we have a Moon. Yippee. Again. Eventually the Earth cools down from the chaos of its formation and becomes a water planet. Three point eight billion years ago, the first life forms, but it won't be multicellular for a couple billion years.
Igneous rocks such as granite and gabbro are used lots for construction due to their strength. Examples include buildings (both interior and exterior), roads, foundations, monuments, and concrete. Limestone, which is a sedimentary rock, is also used to make concrete or asphalt for roads. Shale, which is also a sedimentary rock, is used to make brick and tiles. Gneiss, which is a metamorphic rock, is also used to make buildings and monuments.
Our first stop in Minnesota’s history is one point eight billion years ago. At the time, the location that would eventually become Minnesota was the bottom of the ocean. The mountains of the ancient Earth contained lots of iron, which were slowly eroded away over time. The iron slipped into the ocean, where it reacted with oxygen in the water produced by photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, to make Iron Oxide. The iron oxide precipitated and fell to the ocean floor, where it was buried by other sediments and compressed to form iron ore. That is right, iron ore is a sedimentary rock! At roughly the same time, sediments elsewhere compressed together to form shale, a different sedimentary rock.
Seven hundred million years later, (that is one point one billion years ago in total,) a drastic event began. Minnesota was part of a supercontinent named Rodinia and laid very close to the equator. A magma plume from deep within the mantle rose up and formed a rift in the middle of the supercontinent, and it began to split it apart! Massive volumes of lava poured out of the rift, and a huge basin was formed (remember this for later). Much farther east, a mountain range called the Grenville Mountains began forming. Luckily, the formation of these mountains caused the rift to fail, and the continent did not split apart. The lava from the rift cooled, and formed the various igneous rocks found in Northeastern Minnesota. But the rift has one last trick up its sleeve. The intense heat released by the rift caused the shale (remember that?) to metamorphose into slate, tilting it to a unique forty-five degree angle. This rare slate can be seen nowadays at Jay Cooke State Park.
Skip ahead about half a billion years and things have changed a lot. Life is multicellular and thriving in the Ordovician seas four hundred and fifty million years ago. The area that will eventually become Southeastern Minnesota is a beautiful coral reef in a shallow tropical sea. The rising and falling of seas over a couple million years caused lots of buildup of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, limestone, and dolostone. When creatures in this time period died, their bodies fell to the seafloor and their soft parts rotted away, leaving the hard parts behind. Over time, these body parts (mainly shells) got buried under sediments and rock and were fossilized.
The last stop on our geologic journey through time is the last ice age, which lasted from two point four million years ago to ten thousand years ago. During this ice age, massive ice sheets formed, some up to three miles thick. As the ice sheets plowed across the continent, they acted like bulldozers, flattening land, carving out the Great Lakes (including the basin leftover from the Mid-Continent Rift!), transferring agates farther south (more on them later), and leaving scratches in rocks called Striations. When the glaciers began to recede, sometimes a large chunk would break off and form a lake known as a kettle lake. 
Southeast Minnesota is not just the land of ten thousand limestone deposits, it is also the land of ten thousand random holes in the ground. This is due to the Karst topography of the area. Because the land is built on soft sedimentary limestone, acidic rain can wear away at the rock, creating sinkholes and cave systems. This leads into its own whole section of content, with landforms like disappearing streams and all the speleothems that can be found in the caves down south.
Things are a little different up north. Due to the abundance of igneous rocks, there are no sinkholes or caves. What it does have however, is IRON BABY. OH YEAH WE GET TO TALK ABOUT IRON NOW. (Can you tell that I am tired?) Becuase of all this one point eight billion year old iron ore, people set up a crap ton of mines there. There are three iron ranges in Minnesota, but only one is active nowadays. Companies pay a ton of money to get permits to mine on the land, and they set up giant open-pit mines to find that rich iron ore, and then turn around and sell it for profit. Because of this, Minnesota is the number one iron producer in the country. 
These boring mines are not the only interesting landforms in the northeast. In some places, iron ore combined with other rocks and minerals to create a really interesting feature called the Banded Iron Formation, and scientists today still argue about how it was created. Also, because of that rift incident a little over a billion years ago, we got a ton of basalt and rhyolite and other crap. But inside some of these rocks is something special. When lava cools and hardens, it sometimes has carbon dioxide bubbles inside it. These bubbles are known as vesicles, and get trapped in the rock. Over time, water and minerals such as quartz and silica can fill up the vesicles and form these beautiful gemstones called agates (which are, fun fact, the state gemstone).
There is one more important landform in northeast Minnesota, and it is kinda hard to miss. That is because it is the MASSIVE GREAT LAKE THAT IS LAKE SUPERIOR. Lake Superior has quite a long and interesting backstory of its own, but I do not want to get sidetracked. In short, the rift event created a depression in the ground called a basin. Over the next billion years or so, it got filled in by sediments. When the glaciers showed up over 2 million years ago, they excavated the basin when they carved the other Great Lakes. Then they melted, filling up the basin(s). You might be thinking that that is way too much water to fit in modern-day Lake Superior, and you’d be right. When the lake first filled in, the water level was multiple hundreds of feet higher than it is nowadays. The lake back then was known as Glacial Luke Duluth, and changes in the shoreline created many interesting cliffs and waterfalls, such as the triple falls as Gooseberry State Park.
Okay cool. We got two completely separate areas of Minnesota, each with their own dramatic geologic histories. But are they really that different? Mostly. They do have some similarities. Both regions have sedimentary rocks, but only the northeast has metamorphic and igneous rocks. Both regions have a sea/ocean involved in their formation, but only the southeast has karst topography and caves and sinkholes.
Now I ask myself the question, “what the hell have I actually learned in the past month(ish)?” Well, I have learned about limestone and karst topography. I have learned about caves and sinkholes and how they form. I have learned about all the cute little speleothems you can find in caves, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, cave bacon, and more. I have learned about the ancient seas that once covered the area, and the cephalopods that once lived there. I have learned that Lake Superior was not, in fact, created solely by glaciers like I have been led to believe my whole life. I have learned why Minnesota is the number one iron producer in the country, why there is so much iron there, every important step on how to mine the iron from blasting it out of the ground to crushing it to making it into pellets to shipping it across the lakes to be made into steel. I have learned about the chaos created by the mid continent rift, how it created unique tilted slate and massive lava flows. I have learned how agates form and how to find them (and also the fact that they exist because I had never heard of them before this class). Last but most certainly not least, I have learned to care for my classmates and my home state just a little bit more each and every day.
